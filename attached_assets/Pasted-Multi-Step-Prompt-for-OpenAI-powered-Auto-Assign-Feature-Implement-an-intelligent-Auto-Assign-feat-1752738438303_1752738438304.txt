Multi-Step Prompt for OpenAI-powered Auto-Assign Feature:

Implement an intelligent Auto-Assign feature leveraging our OpenAI integration, trained on historical UPH and production data from our app. Clearly follow these steps:

Step 1: Data Preparation & Training

Aggregate historical UPH data by operator, work center, operation, and routing.

Train OpenAI integration to recognize operator strengths and constraints based on historical assignments and UPH.

Step 2: Auto-Assignment Logic

When the user clicks "Auto-Assign," OpenAI should evaluate all MOs and available operators, assigning operators to tasks by optimizing total production hours and rigorously respecting operator constraints.

Clearly document and log all OpenAI recommendations for transparency.

Prioritize accurate projections based on validated historical performance data.

Step 3: UX/UI Features for Auto-Assign

Add an "Auto-Assign" button prominently at the top of the Production Planning Grid.

Include visual indicators showing auto-assigned tasks distinctly from manually assigned tasks (e.g., different color or icon).

Step 4: Sub-Features & Controls

Implement a "Try Again" button allowing users to quickly regenerate auto-assignments if unsatisfied with initial assignments. There should be a button next to the refresh (table) button that allows a full refresh, as well as refresh icons on each routing row as well as workcenter column.

Add a "Clear All" button to remove all current assignments (both auto and manual) quickly. This should also be on each routing row and work center column.

Provide detailed tooltips or modals explaining the rationale behind each auto-assignment decision, explicitly highlighting operator constraints and historical performance accuracy.

Step 5: Manual Override Capability

Ensure users can manually override any OpenAI-generated assignment through dropdown adjustments.

Visually indicate manual overrides clearly.

Step 6: Validation and Error Handling

Include robust validation to strictly enforce operator constraints post auto-assignment.

Clearly communicate any detected issues or conflicts via warnings or actionable notifications, ensuring all assignments meet constraints and accurate performance projections.

This structured approach ensures a reliable, user-friendly, AI-enhanced auto-assignment workflow that complements manual scheduling efforts and rigorously adheres to operator constraints and accuracy.
