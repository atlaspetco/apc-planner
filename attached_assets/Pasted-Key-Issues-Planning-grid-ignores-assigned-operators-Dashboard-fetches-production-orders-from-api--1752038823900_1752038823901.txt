Key Issues

Planning grid ignores assigned operators.
Dashboard fetches production orders from /api/fulfil/current-production-orders, which only returns raw Fulfil data. These records don’t include assignedOperatorId or estimatedHours, so operator selections disappear after assignment. Lines showing the API usage:

25  // Get current production orders from Fulfil API
26  const { data: currentPOs = [], isLoading: isLoadingCurrentPOs, refetch: refetchCurrentPOs } = useQuery({
27    queryKey: ["/api/fulfil/current-production-orders"],

The grid renders with these Fulfil orders:

138          <PlanningGrid
139            productionOrders={currentPOs.orders || []}

Because the data doesn’t come from the local DB, assignments and hours are lost.

Suggested task
Use DB production orders for planning grid

Start task
Operator dropdown resets after assignment.
BatchSection sends the assignment but never updates local data. onSuccess merely invalidates /api/work-orders:

48      onSuccess: () => {
49        queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/work-orders"] });
50        toast({
51          title: "Success",
52          description: "Operator assigned successfully",
53        });

Since <MORow> relies on the unchanged order.workOrders array, the dropdown value reverts to empty.

Suggested task
Persist operator selection in BatchSection

Start task
Hours to complete uses a placeholder.
In <MORow> expected hours are calculated with a hard-coded value:

223                        const calculateExpectedHours = (operatorId: number) => {
224                          // This would use UPH data to calculate expected hours
225                          const mockUph = 15; // Placeholder - would come from actual UPH data
226                          return (order.quantity / mockUph).toFixed(1);

Suggested task
Calculate expected hours from real UPH data

Start task
Operator summary may miss assignments for larger datasets.
/api/work-orders paginates results with a default limit of 50:

106    app.get("/api/work-orders", async (req, res) => {
107      // Add pagination support for large datasets
108      const page = parseInt(req.query.page as string) || 1;
109      const limit = parseInt(req.query.limit as string) || 50;

OperatorSummary requests this endpoint once without pagination, so operators might not see all assigned work orders when more than 50 exist.

Suggested task
Return all work orders for OperatorSummary

Start task
Testing

Run unit tests and any existing integration tests after implementing the changes.

Manually assign operators in the dashboard to verify that selections persist and hours are calculated.

Confirm that the Operator Summary reflects newly assigned work orders.
