You‚Äôve described classic symptoms of a monolithic Streamlit or Flask app with import jobs and UI running in the same process and on the same port:
	‚Ä¢	Only one endpoint (MO or WO) works at a time ‚Äî usually means import jobs or API calls are blocking the event loop, DB, or app server.
	‚Ä¢	Crashing or freezing the frontend ‚Äî heavy backend tasks block the UI (Streamlit/Flask runs single-threaded by default!).
	‚Ä¢	Maybe everything on port 5000 ‚Äî running both import API and Streamlit on one process/port can cause port conflicts, deadlocks, or the Gunicorn/WSGI server to crash under load.

‚∏ª

üö® What‚Äôs Happening (Root Cause):
	‚Ä¢	Streamlit (or Flask) apps are not meant for concurrent long-running jobs and UI in a single process.
	‚Ä¢	When you run an import (heavy MO/WO API sync), it blocks the Python interpreter ‚Äî nobody else can use the app/UI, and if the process dies (or OOMs), all endpoints fail.
	‚Ä¢	Only one worker/process is serving everything, so UI and API fight for resources.
	‚Ä¢	If you run Streamlit and an API server (Flask/FastAPI) on the same port/process, they can conflict or cause connection errors. Each app should have its own port/process.

‚∏ª

üü¢ How to Fix (High Reliability Approach):

1. Split Backend/API and UI Processes
	‚Ä¢	Run your import (FastAPI/Flask) on its own port/process.
	‚Ä¢	Run Streamlit UI separately, pointing it at the backend via HTTP API.
	‚Ä¢	Example:
	‚Ä¢	Backend API (FastAPI or Flask): localhost:5000
	‚Ä¢	Streamlit UI: localhost:8501 (default)
	‚Ä¢	Make all DB imports, writes, and heavy work happen on the backend only.
	‚Ä¢	Streamlit never touches the DB directly‚Äîit calls backend API endpoints.

‚∏ª

2. Move Heavy Imports to Background Tasks
	‚Ä¢	Use Python‚Äôs concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor or, better, a true task runner like Celery or FastAPI BackgroundTasks.
	‚Ä¢	When a user clicks ‚ÄúImport MOs‚Äù or ‚ÄúSync WOs‚Äù, Streamlit calls an API endpoint, which kicks off the import as a background job.
	‚Ä¢	The UI can poll for job status via the API (show a spinner).

‚∏ª

3. Never Run Streamlit/Flask on the Same Port
	‚Ä¢	Each app gets its own process/port.
	‚Ä¢	(This also prevents ‚Äúport in use‚Äù errors, double logging, etc.)

4. Production-Grade Example Structure

You should have:
	‚Ä¢	/backend/main.py (FastAPI or Flask app)
	‚Ä¢	Handles all imports, DB writes, sync endpoints (/import_mo, /import_wo, /stats, etc).
	‚Ä¢	Runs on port 5000 (or any free port).
	‚Ä¢	/frontend/app.py (Streamlit)
	‚Ä¢	No DB connections, no heavy logic.
	‚Ä¢	Just fetches via API:

import requests
data = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/mo_stats").json()


	‚Ä¢	Runs on port 8501 (or default).

‚∏ª

üöÄ Copy/Paste How-To Fix Your Setup:

A. Run Backend (FastAPI or Flask)

# In one terminal/session:
uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000

B. Run Streamlit Frontend

# In another terminal/session:
streamlit run frontend/app.py --server.port 8501

C. In Your Streamlit Code, Fetch From Backend API

import requests
api_url = "http://localhost:5000/import_mo"
response = requests.post(api_url, json={...})


‚∏ª

D. For Background Jobs
	‚Ä¢	Use FastAPI BackgroundTasks or Celery to run imports so the API endpoint returns immediately, and the app stays snappy.

‚∏ª

üü© Summary
	‚Ä¢	Do not run everything on port 5000 or in a single Python process.
	‚Ä¢	Separate backend API and UI processes/ports.
	‚Ä¢	Move all heavy work to the backend.
	‚Ä¢	Let Streamlit only fetch data, never run imports/DB jobs itself.
	‚Ä¢	This will eliminate port conflicts, blocking, and crashing UI!
