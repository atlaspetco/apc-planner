Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown of how fulfil_api.py authenticates with the Fulfil API, and how to instruct Replit Agent to use the same authentication flow for your new production planning app.

‚úÖ Fulfil API Authentication Summary

üîê Method Used: API Key (X-API-KEY Header)

This service uses token-based authentication, not OAuth, and authenticates every request by sending a header:

X-API-KEY: <your-token>


‚∏ª

üß± How Authentication Works in Code

1. Token Source
	‚Ä¢	Pulled from an environment variable:

stored_token = os.getenv("FULFIL_ACCESS_TOKEN")


	‚Ä¢	This token is assumed to already be generated manually from Fulfil‚Äôs API credentials (not via OAuth).

2. Header Injection
	‚Ä¢	The token is added to the request headers like so:

self.headers['X-API-KEY'] = self.access_token



3. Header Used in All Requests
	‚Ä¢	Every request (GET or POST) includes:

headers=self.headers

which already has:

{
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "X-API-KEY": "<your-token>"
}

üìò Instructions for Replit Agent Integration

When generating requests to Fulfil‚Äôs API:
	1.	Add this header to every request:

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-API-KEY": os.getenv("FULFIL_ACCESS_TOKEN")  # stored in Replit Secrets
}


	2.	Set environment variable:
	‚Ä¢	Store FULFIL_ACCESS_TOKEN in Replit‚Äôs Secrets Manager.
	3.	Use in all requests (example):

import os
import requests

FULFIL_API_KEY = os.getenv("FULFIL_ACCESS_TOKEN")

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-API-KEY": FULFIL_API_KEY
}

response = requests.get("https://apc.fulfil.io/api/v2/model/production", headers=headers)



‚∏ª

üß™ Optional Connection Test Endpoint
	‚Ä¢	You can check API connectivity by calling:

GET https://apc.fulfil.io/api/v2/model/production?per_page=1

‚úÖ TL;DR for Replit Agent Prompt

To authenticate with the Fulfil API, add the following header to every request:

X-API-KEY: 

This token should be stored securely in Replit Secrets Manager. All requests to the Fulfil API (GET or POST) should include this header along with `Content-Type: application/json`. No OAuth or refresh token flow is needed.
