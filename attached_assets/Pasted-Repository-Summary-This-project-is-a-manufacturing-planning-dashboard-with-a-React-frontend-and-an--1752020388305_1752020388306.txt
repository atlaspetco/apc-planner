Repository Summary

This project is a manufacturing planning dashboard with a React frontend and an Express/TypeScript backend. The README outlines key features including a real‑time production dashboard, Fulfil.io integration and UPH analytics. The database schema defines tables for production orders, work orders, operators and UPH data.

Backend routes provide endpoints to retrieve and modify production orders, work orders and operators. For example, /api/work-orders/assign-operator assigns an operator to a work order using UPH data when available. Automatic syncing with Fulfil.io is managed in auto-sync.ts, which imports completed orders and calculates UPH metrics. Work cycle aggregation and UPH calculation are handled in aggregate-work-cycles.ts.

On the frontend, the dashboard page uses the planning grid component to display production orders and allow operator assignment. Operator settings include toggles for work centers, operations and routings with hints about available UPH data. The Fulfil settings page supports CSV uploads of historical data and enhanced import operations.

Issues & Suggestions
Incorrect column reference for active production orders

The endpoint /api/fulfil/mo-time-estimates queries productionOrders.isActive, but the production orders table does not define this column. This likely causes a runtime error.

Excerpt

const activeMOs = await db.select()
  .from(productionOrders)
  .where(eq(productionOrders.isActive, true));

Suggested task
Fix active MO query

Placeholder UPH values in operator assignment

In the planning grid, expected hours per operator are calculated using a fixed value (const mockUph = 15) instead of real UPH data.

Excerpt

const calculateExpectedHours = (operatorId: number) => {
  const mockUph = 15; // Placeholder
  return (order.quantity / mockUph).toFixed(1);
};

Suggested task
Use real UPH data for expected hours

Start task
Operator assignment and work center addition marked as TODO

The dashboard page has TODO comments indicating missing functionality for assigning operators and adding work centers.

Excerpt

const handleAddWorkCenter = (moId: string, workCenter: string) => {
  console.log(`Adding work center ${workCenter} to MO ${moId}`);
  // TODO: Implement work center assignment API
};

const handleAssignOperator = (workOrderId: string, operatorId: string) => {
  console.log(`Assigning operator ${operatorId} to work order ${workOrderId}`);
  // TODO: Implement operator assignment API
};

Suggested task
Implement dashboard assignment actions

Start task
These adjustments will align the implementation with the repository’s intended functionality and provide accurate scheduling based on real UPH data.
