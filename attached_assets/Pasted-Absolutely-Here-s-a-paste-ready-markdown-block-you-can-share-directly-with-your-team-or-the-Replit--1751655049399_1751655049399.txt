# Technical Review: Production Planning App

## 1. App Architecture & Data Flow

**Backend & Data Model**
- MOs, WOs, and Work Cycles are separate entities in `/shared/schema.ts`, linked by IDs (e.g., WO has `productionOrderId` linking to MO; Work Cycle links to WO).
- Data is stored locally (Drizzle ORM), imported via CSV or Fulfil API (`csv-import-final.ts`, `work-cycles-import.ts`).
- Main API (`server/routes.ts`): CRUD for MOs, WOs, operators, batches, analytics (including UPH).
- Import: Work cycles and WOs can be imported via CSV or Fulfil API sync.
- Aggregation: UPH and analytics logic are in `aggregate-work-cycles.ts`, `uph-work-orders.ts`, and `authentic-uph-calculator.ts`.

**Frontend**
- Dashboard and planning UIs are under `/client/src/pages/` and `/client/src/components/dashboard/`.
- Dashboards aggregate and display MO/WO assignment, operator metrics, and calculated UPH.

## 2. Calculation Logic (UPH & Efficiency)

**How UPH Is Calculated**
- UPH (Units Per Hour) = `Total Units Completed` / (`Total Time in Seconds` / 3600)
- Grouped by **operator**, **work center**, **routing**, and often **operation**.
- Calculation files: `aggregate-work-cycles.ts`, `uph-work-orders.ts`, `authentic-uph-calculator.ts`.

**Potential Issues & Bugs**
- **Grouping:** If any field (operator, work center, routing, operation) is missed, UPH can be inaccurate.
- **Zero Handling:** Guards against zero division are present but not fully consistent—sometimes skips are silent.
- **Time Window:** Not all calculations enforce a time window; old data may dilute UPH.
- **Data Mapping:** If imported work cycles or WOs lack links, they are silently excluded.
- **Duplicate Cycles:** No clear deduplication in import; possible to double-import and inflate UPH.

**Averaging**
- Averaging is handled by query filters (date, operator, work center, routing, operation), but not always exposed in the frontend.

## 3. Import Functions

**CSV Import**
- `csv-import-final.ts`, `work-cycles-import.ts`: Parse and normalize CSVs, mapping fields to DB.
- **Edge Cases:**
    - Blank/malformed rows are sometimes skipped, but no user-facing summary.
    - No deduplication of imported cycles—possible to double-import.
    - Operator/work center mapping is case-sensitive; mismatches drop data.
    - Sometimes missing WOs/operators create new records, sometimes not.

**API Import**
- Via `fulfil-api.ts`. No retry logic on fetches, no logging of failed imports, and no transactional rollback.

**Suggestions**
- Deduplicate work cycles on (WO, timestamp, operator, quantity) when importing.
- Add a post-import summary: “X rows imported, Y skipped (reason), Z deduped.”
- Normalize operator/work center names to a standard case.
- Consider a preview-and-confirm step for large CSVs.

---

## 4. UPH Generation/Refresh

**Auto-Recalculation**
- UPH is **not always recalculated automatically** after import; sometimes a manual trigger or refresh is needed.
- No guarantee UPH data is “fresh” after new work cycles are imported.

**Improvements**
- **Trigger UPH recalculation** automatically after every import.
- Add log/status messages after import to confirm UPH was updated or if calcs failed.
- For larger data, add a job queue/status for UPH calculations.

## 5. General Recommendations

| Area          | Observations                                                        | Suggested Improvements                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Imports**   | No dedupe, no error summary, silent skips, case-sensitive mapping   | Add dedupe, explicit logs, case-insensitive mapping |
| **UPH Logic** | Inconsistent grouping, no forced time window in all queries         | Enforce grouping by operator/work center/routing/operation/time window |
| **Error Handling** | Silent failures/skips, no user feedback                        | Log skipped/failed records with reasons          |
| **Type Safety**    | Decent, but CSV import is loose                                | Stronger types/validation at import boundary     |
| **Performance**    | OK for small/medium data; no chunked imports for very large    | Add chunking, batch jobs for >10k row imports    |
| **Maintainability**| Code modular, good start; docs sparse in some files            | Add docblocks/examples for all aggregation and import fns |

## 6. Output: High-Priority Fixes & Examples

### High Priority
- **Deduplication:** Add deduplication to `csv-import-final.ts` and `work-cycles-import.ts`.
- **UPH Refresh:** In `aggregate-work-cycles.ts` and `uph-work-orders.ts`, ensure recalculation is triggered after every import.
- **Grouping Logic:** Double-check grouping logic in all UPH calculation files; always include operation, routing, work center, operator, and a time window.
- **Error Summaries:** Add detailed error/warning logging in all import/aggregation scripts (ideally collect and return to UI).

#### Example: Add Deduplication (Pseudo)
```ts
// After parsing imported work cycles, dedupe on (workOrderId, operatorId, timestamp, quantity)
const uniqueCycles = Array.from(new Map(parsedCycles.map(c => 
  [`${c.workOrderId}|${c.operatorId}|${c.timestamp}|${c.quantity}`, c]
)).values());

Example: Trigger UPH Recalc

// At the end of your CSV/API import
await recalculateAllUph(); // This would re-aggregate all UPH data


⸻

Quick Wins
	•	Deduplicate on import.
	•	Enforce grouping in UPH (operator, work center, operation, routing, window).
	•	Add logs for all skipped/failed records, and summary to UI.
	•	Trigger UPH refresh after import.

Long-Term Suggestions
	•	Modularize importers and calculators for future extension.
	•	Add test coverage for all aggregation, import, and mapping logic.
	•	Implement a real-time/async job status update for imports and heavy calcs.
	•	Document all aggregation/grouping strategies with JSDoc/TSDoc.
