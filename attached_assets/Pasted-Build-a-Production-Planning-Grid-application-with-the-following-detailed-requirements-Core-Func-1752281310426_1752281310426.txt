Build a Production Planning Grid application with the following detailed requirements:

## Core Functionality:

The Production Planning Grid is designed to clearly display and manage operator assignments and projected completion times for Manufacturing Orders (MOs) across three primary work centers: **Cutting**, **Assembly**, and **Packaging**.

## Grid Structure:

* **Columns:** Represent work centers (**Cutting**, **Assembly**, **Packaging**).
* **Rows:** Represent unique **Product Routings** from currently active (incomplete) MOs.

## Operator Assignment:

* Each cell (intersection of Routing row and Work Center column) initially defaults to the assumption that one operator handles all associated production.
* Each cell includes a dropdown allowing the assignment of specific operators for granular management at the individual MO level.

## UPH (Units Per Hour) Calculation:

* Aggregate historical completed Work Cycle durations (in seconds) by Operator + Routing + Work Center from MOs in the "Done" state.
* Convert aggregated duration to hours and calculate UPH:
  $\text{UPH} = \frac{\text{Total Quantity Produced}}{\frac{\text{Aggregated Duration (seconds)}}{3600}}$
* Average UPH per Operator, Routing, and Work Center combination based on a user-defined historical window specified in Operator Settings (e.g., last 30 days).

## Forecasting Completion Times:

* For each active MO, calculate estimated completion time based on:
  $\text{Estimated Time (hrs)} = \frac{\text{MO Quantity}}{\text{Operator UPH}}$
* Clearly display the estimated time within the corresponding cell.

## Operator Settings:

* Allow operators to define their historical averaging window (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days).
* Include toggles enabling or disabling assignment for specific Routings or Work Centers.
* Specify operator scheduling constraints:

  * Maximum weekly hours (e.g., 40 hours).
  * Percentage of maximum hours scheduled (e.g., 90% of 40 hours = 36 hours per week).

## UI & User Experience:

* Ensure grid readability and intuitive operator assignment with dynamic dropdown selection.
* Instantly recalculate estimated completion times upon operator assignment changes.
* Provide visual indicators for workloads exceeding operator weekly constraints.

## Future Proofing (V2 Readiness):

* Build data structures and calculation logic ready to integrate OpenAI auto-assignment based on operator constraints and optimized scheduling.

This grid must provide clear, accurate, actionable production planning metrics to improve resource allocation and production efficiency.
