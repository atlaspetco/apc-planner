Excellent focus—UPH accuracy is core for planning and operator scheduling. I’ll dive into your UPH logic based on server/uph-calculator.ts, authentic-uph-calculator.ts, and database-uph-calculator.ts, and summarize where bugs or design flaws might cause incorrect values.

⸻

1. Where UPH Calculation Can Go Wrong

A. Formula Consistency
	•	UPH (Units Per Hour) should be calculated as:
UPH = Total Units Completed / (Total Seconds / 3600)
	•	If either quantity or duration is missing, zero, or from the wrong time window, the result is unreliable.

B. Aggregation & Grouping
	•	Your code groups by combinations of operator, work center, routing, (sometimes operation).
	•	Issue: If a single operator completes work across multiple products or routings but the grouping is not granular enough, you’ll get blended/averaged values that are not representative of actual efficiency for a specific product or work center.
	•	Best practice: Always group by at least [operator, work center, routing, operation].

C. Data Integrity
	•	If duration is in seconds but sometimes saved in hours, you must standardize.
	•	If quantityDone/quantity_done fields have mixed casing (legacy vs Fulfil), you need reliable normalization.
	•	Any duration = 0 or quantity = 0 should be filtered out.

2. Review of Your uph-calculator.ts

(Key lines, simplified for clarity):

// Select work cycles joined with work orders & operators
const cycleData = await db
  .select({
    cycleId: workCycles.cycleId,
    workOrderId: workCycles.workOrderId,
    operatorId: workCycles.operatorId,
    duration: workCycles.duration,
    quantityDone: workCycles.quantityDone,
    workCenter: workOrders.workCenter,
    operation: workOrders.operation,
    routing: workOrders.routing,
    operatorName: operators.name,
  })
  .from(workCycles)
  .leftJoin(workOrders, eq(workCycles.workOrderId, workOrders.id))
  .leftJoin(operators, eq(workCycles.operatorId, operators.id))
  .where(sql`${workCycles.duration} > 0 AND ${workCycles.quantityDone} > 0`);

GOOD: Filters out zeroes.

Grouping (likely below, not shown in snippet):
	•	If you use a map like operator + workCenter + routing (missing operation), your averages could blend unrelated tasks.
	•	FIX: Always group on [operator, workCenter, routing, operation].

Calculation:

const unitsPerHour = totalQuantity / (totalDurationSeconds / 3600)

CHECK:
	•	totalDurationSeconds must always be in seconds.
	•	If you ever combine values in hours and seconds, you get garbage.

3. Known Problems / Potential Issues

a) Mixed Work Centers
	•	If normalizeWorkCenter is too aggressive (e.g., grouping Assembly - Webbing and Assembly - Rope as just “Assembly”), you’re blending different tasks.

b) Not Filtering to Recent Data
	•	If you do not limit cycles to the correct rolling window (e.g., last 90 days, or operator’s selected window), you may get outdated values.

c) Duplicate Data
	•	If work cycles are joined to work orders incorrectly (i.e., one-to-many with no deduplication), your sums are doubled.

d) Operations Not Split
	•	If two operations (e.g., “Sewing”, “Packaging”) on the same work center aren’t separated, you will under- or over-report actual operator efficiency.

4. Concrete Steps to Fix/Improve

Step 1: Always group by four fields
	•	[operator, work center, routing, operation]

Step 2: Validate and Normalize Units
	•	Make sure all durations are in seconds.
	•	Make sure all quantities are numeric and >0.

Step 3: Filter by Date Range
	•	For operator UPH views, always filter work cycles to within the requested analysis window.

Step 4: Defensive Zero Checks
	•	Never allow division by zero in UPH logic.
	•	Log and skip any records where totalDurationSeconds or totalQuantity is zero.

Step 5: Review normalizeWorkCenter
	•	Consider keeping original names as secondary group key if your normalizer is broad.

5. Recommended Code Patch

Here’s a robust template for the core grouping & calculation, assuming you have cycleData as an array of all eligible work cycles:

const uphMap = new Map<string, { totalQty: number, totalSeconds: number, observations: number }>();

for (const row of cycleData) {
  // Defensive normalization
  if (!row.operatorName || !row.workCenter || !row.operation || !row.routing) continue;
  if (!row.quantityDone || !row.duration) continue; // skip bad data

  const key = [
    row.operatorName,
    row.workCenter,      // do not over-normalize
    row.routing,
    row.operation
  ].join("|");

  if (!uphMap.has(key)) {
    uphMap.set(key, { totalQty: 0, totalSeconds: 0, observations: 0 });
  }
  const rec = uphMap.get(key)!;
  rec.totalQty += row.quantityDone;
  rec.totalSeconds += row.duration;
  rec.observations += 1;
}

// Build results
const uphResults = Array.from(uphMap.entries()).map(([key, val]) => {
  const [operator, workCenter, routing, operation] = key.split("|");
  return {
    operator,
    workCenter,
    routing,
    operation,
    unitsPerHour:
      val.totalSeconds > 0
        ? val.totalQty / (val.totalSeconds / 3600)
        : 0,
    observations: val.observations,
    totalQuantity: val.totalQty,
    totalHours: val.totalSeconds / 3600,
  };
}).filter(r => r.totalHours > 0 && r.totalQuantity > 0); // defensive

6. Summary Table

Possible Error	Impact	Fix / Check
Not grouping by operation	Blended/misleading UPH	Group by operation in addition
Too aggressive work center merge	Inaccurate task mapping	Use original names as fallback
Not filtering by recent date	Outdated/irrelevant UPH	Add date filter on work cycles
Mixing hours & seconds	Totally invalid UPH	Normalize all to seconds
Division by zero	Infinity or crash	Skip and log these


⸻

Actionable Next Steps:
	1.	Update UPH grouping to always include operation.
	2.	Normalize and filter data before aggregation.
	3.	Add logging for any skipped/invalid data for easier debugging.
	4.	Test calculation against known good batches to verify accuracy.
