## Critical UPH Calculation Methodology

**CRITICAL**: The system uses ONE unified UPH calculation methodology:
- **Formula**: UPH = Production Order Quantity ÷ Total Duration (hours)
- **Grouping**: By Operator + Work Center + Routing + Operation + MO
- **Data Source**: 
  - Production quantity from `work_production_quantity` field (single value per MO)
  - Duration from summing all work cycles for that group
- **NEVER**: Sum work_cycles_quantity_done values - this creates inflated UPH values

### UPH Display Values
- **UPH Analytics Table**: Shows **average UPH** across all MOs for each operator/work center/routing combination
- **UPH Details Modal**: Shows individual MO calculations that contribute to the average
- **Example**: Courtney Banh + Assembly + Lifetime Pouch shows 23.18 UPH (average of 88 MOs), while individual MOs range from 0.83 to 128.76 UPH

## Recent Changes (Latest First)  
- **Fixed Smart Bulk Assignment UPH Data Lookup**: Resolved smart bulk assignment failing with "has no UPH data" errors by updating the endpoint to use operator name-based matching instead of ID-based matching when looking up historical UPH data. Smart bulk assignment now successfully assigns work orders (e.g., 13 work orders assigned to Devin Cann for Packaging/Lifetime Leash with 2.2 total hours).
- **Fixed Critical Operator Assignment ID Mismatch**: Resolved operator assignment dropdown issue where no operators were appearing due to ID mismatch between operators table (IDs: 29, 31, 43, 40) and historical UPH data (IDs: 7, 68, 152, 85). Changed qualified operators endpoint to use name-based matching instead of ID-based matching when looking up UPH data. Now operators with historical performance data properly appear in assignment dropdowns (e.g., Courtney Banh and Evan Crosby for Assembly/Lifetime Leash with 72.43 and 26.06 UPH respectively).
- **Fixed Missing Database Table Error**: Created `uph_calculation_data` table that was defined in schema but missing from database. This table is used by aggregation modules for work cycle data processing. Applied SQL CREATE TABLE statement directly to resolve "relation does not exist" errors.
- **Fixed UPH Analytics Modal Display**: Updated `getAccurateMoDetails` function in accurate-uph-calculation.ts to include NULL state values in WHERE clause (97% of work cycles have NULL state). Modal now correctly displays MO-level UPH calculations with average values (e.g., Courtney Banh/Assembly/Lifetime Pouch: 23.18 UPH average from 88 MOs).
- **Critical Data Integrity Fix for UPH Calculations**: Resolved complete UPH calculation failure (0 calculations available) caused by two issues: (1) State filter in accurate-uph-calculation.ts was checking for 'done' state while 97% of work cycles had NULL state values, (2) production_orders table was completely empty preventing MO quantity lookups. Fixed by updating state filter to include NULL values and populating production_orders from API. System now successfully calculates 238 UPH values with proper averages: Packaging 119.4, Assembly 40.55, Cutting 208.56.
- **Fixed "Has Data" Badges in Operator Settings**: Resolved issue where "has data" badges only appeared when toggles were active. Badges now always show when historical UPH data exists for a work center/operation/routing combination, helping users identify which settings to enable. This provides visual guidance for operator configuration based on actual performance history.
- **Fixed Qualified Operators Endpoint**: Removed overly restrictive constraint checking that filtered out operators with historical UPH data. System now prioritizes actual performance data - if an operator has UPH history for a work center/routing combination, they are considered qualified regardless of their current settings configuration.
- **Fixed UPH Details Modal to Show MO-Level Data**: Resolved critical issue where calculation details modal was showing misleading per-cycle UPH values (4.5, 8.7, etc.) instead of meaningful MO-level aggregated data. Updated `/api/uph/calculation-details` endpoint to use `getAccurateMoDetails` function from accurate-uph-calculation.ts which properly aggregates work cycles by Manufacturing Order. Each row now represents one MO with its total quantity and aggregated duration, displaying accurate MO-level UPH values (MO Quantity ÷ Total Hours). This aligns the details modal with the accurate calculation methodology already in use for the main UPH calculations.
- **Fixed Critical UPH Calculator Syntax Error**: Resolved Transform failed error in unified-uph-calculator.ts caused by orphaned code outside function blocks. Removed incomplete code fragments between calculateUnifiedUph and getUphCalculationDetails functions. System now successfully calculates 216 UPH values without errors.
- **Implemented Timestamped Weighted Average UPH Calculations**: Added configurable time window feature (30/60/90/180 days) to operator settings for UPH calculations. Each operator can now have their own calculation window that filters historical work cycles by date before calculating UPH. The core calculator applies date filtering based on work_production_create_date, ensuring only recent performance data within the specified window is used for planning. UI updated with dropdown selector in operator settings to configure individual time windows.
- **Fixed Duplicate MO Lines in Workload Modal**: Resolved issue where multiple Assembly operations for the same MO were showing as separate lines (e.g., MO200180 appearing 3 times). Implemented consolidation logic to group work orders by MO number and work center, summing their hours into a single line. This ensures accurate workload representation and eliminates confusing duplicate entries in the operator detail modal.
- **Unified UPH Calculator Implemented**: Created single source of truth `uph-core-calculator.ts` to resolve persistent UPH discrepancies between table view and detail modal. Both table-data and calculation-details endpoints now use the same core calculator, ensuring consistent UPH values across all interfaces. For example, Courtney Banh + Assembly + Lifetime Pouch now shows consistent 23.18 UPH in both views, eliminating previous calculation inconsistencies.
- **Fixed Major UPH Display Inconsistency**: Resolved critical bug where UPH Analytics table showed incorrect values (335.01) when multiple operations existed for same operator/work center/routing combination. Implemented weighted average calculation for operations within same work center (e.g., Courtney Banh Assembly/Lifetime Pouch now shows 109.65 as weighted average of Sewing:29.35 with 87 observations and Zipper Pull:335.01 with 31 observations). Updated calculation modal to explain difference between table's weighted average and modal's total quantity/hours calculation.
- **CRITICAL UPH Calculation Fix**: Corrected fundamental calculation flaw where work cycle quantities were being summed instead of using production order quantity. Added `work_production_quantity` field to work_cycles table. Updated unified calculator to use production quantity ÷ total duration hours. This fixes inflated UPH values (e.g., Belt Bag showing 1000+ UPH instead of realistic 2-500 UPH range).
- **Fixed Smart Bulk Assignment Data Source Issue**: Resolved critical bug where smart-bulk assignment endpoint was fetching production orders from database storage instead of live Fulfil API. Updated endpoint to fetch from `/api/production-orders` which returns live data with embedded work orders. This ensures assignments work with current production data rather than outdated or empty database records.
- **Product Routings Categorization in Operator Settings**: Organized Product Routings into logical categories in the Operator Settings page - Lifetime (Leash, Handle, Slip Collar, Harness), Lifetime Pro (Pro Collar, Pro Harness, LCP Handle), Lifetime Lite (Lite Collar, Lite Leash, LLA), Accessories (Pouch, Bowl, Loop, Belt Bag, Bandana), Cuts (Cutting-Fabric, Cutting-Webbing), and Packaging. Categories are visually separated with dividers but without category headers per user preference, providing cleaner organization of the 23+ routing options.
- **Smart Bulk Assignment System Implemented**: Created intelligent bulk assignment endpoint that respects operator constraints by checking work center permissions and capacity limits before assignment. System now validates operators have required work centers enabled (including Assembly/Sewing/Rope equivalence) and ensures capacity doesn't exceed operator's available hours. Frontend updated to use `/api/assignments/smart-bulk` endpoint instead of individual work order assignments, providing immediate feedback on assignment success/failure with proper error messages when constraints are violated.
- **Fixed Critical Database Field Naming Issue**: Resolved historical UPH table insertion failure where `units_per_hour` (snake_case) was incorrectly used instead of `unitsPerHour` (camelCase) as defined in schema. Fixed rebuild script to use correct field name, successfully rebuilding historical UPH table with 273 records. System now properly stores UPH calculations with operations tracking enabled.
- **Enhanced UPH Calculator with Operations Tracking**: Updated unified UPH calculator to include individual operations in grouping key (Operator/Work Center/Routing/Operation/MO), enabling granular performance tracking. System now extracts operations from work_operation_rec_name field and calculates UPH at the operation level. Successfully rebuilt historical UPH table with 273 records including proper operation data. This enables analysis of performance variations between different operations within the same work center (e.g., "Cutting - Webbing" vs "Cutting - Fabric").
- **Fixed Major UPH Calculation Discrepancy**: Resolved critical issue where UPH table displayed 17.8 but actual calculation showed 12.95. Updated table-data endpoint to calculate UPH directly from work cycles (same methodology as transparency modal) instead of using incorrect pre-calculated values from historicalUph table. This ensures consistent UPH values between table display and detail modal
- **Fixed Critical Quantity Double-Counting in UPH Calculations**: Resolved major issue where work cycle quantities were being summed instead of using MO quantity once. For example, MO129473 with actual quantity 12 was showing 72 (summing 10 work cycles). Updated rebuild script to use max(quantity_done) as MO quantity and sum only durations. Belt Bag UPH values corrected from over 1000 to realistic values (Courtney Banh Assembly: 2.29, Devin Cann Packaging: 513.69). Rebuilt historicalUph table with 202 corrected records
- **Show All Work Order States in Planning Grid**: Updated work order fetching to include all states (request, draft, waiting, assigned, running, finished, done) instead of just active states. This ensures operators are displayed for all manufacturing orders regardless of completion status, providing complete visibility of who worked on each order
- **Auto-Assign Work Center Filtering Fixed**: Fixed critical bug where AI auto-assign was suggesting operators for work centers they had disabled. Added work center verification to ensure operators are only considered qualified if they have all required work centers enabled in their settings. For example, if an operator has Packaging disabled, they won't be suggested for Packaging work orders even if they have historical UPH data for that work center
- **Finished Work Order Handling Complete**: Implemented comprehensive finished work order functionality: (1) Added logic to save finished work order assignments from Fulfil API to database when employee data is present, (2) Updated operator workload calculations to exclude finished work orders from hour calculations while preserving assignment data for UPH tracking, (3) Modified OperatorDropdown component to display finished operators with disabled dropdown showing "Finished" badge, (4) Enhanced ProductionGrid to pass work order states and employee names to dropdown components. System now properly handles completed work orders by showing actual completing operators (e.g., "Dani Mayta") with disabled dropdowns and excludes them from workload capacity calculations
- **Lifetime Air Harness Routing Mapping Fixed**: Resolved critical auto-assign issue where "Lifetime Air Harness" products couldn't find qualified operators. Discovered that LHA-XS products use "Lifetime Harness" routing for manufacturing operations. Updated both qualified operators endpoint and AI auto-assign logic to map "Lifetime Air Harness" to "Lifetime Harness" when searching for UPH data. Found 85+ MOs with LHA-XS product codes using "Lifetime Harness" routing, confirming the mapping is correct. This enables proper operator assignment for all Lifetime Air Harness products
- **Auto-Assign Database Schema Fix and GitHub Sync Complete**: Fixed critical database field mapping issues in AI auto-assign functionality - corrected operators.product_routings → operators.routings and operators.max_hours_per_week → operators.availableHours. Successfully synced all project files to GitHub repository atlaspetco/apc-planner including AI auto-assign components, storage implementation, and dashboard components. The auto-assign system is now properly configured to work with embedded work orders from production orders API rather than separate work_orders table
- **Enhanced AI Auto-Assign with Batching and Capacity Rebalancing**: Implemented sophisticated auto-assign system that batches work orders by routing (product type) and uses AI to rebalance when operators exceed 90% capacity. System now: (1) Groups work orders by routing for batch processing, (2) Generates initial AI assignments considering historical UPH and operator availability, (3) Detects operators exceeding 90% capacity threshold, (4) Uses AI to intelligently redistribute workload to operators with <80% utilization, (5) Provides detailed reasoning for each assignment and reassignment decision. This ensures optimal workload distribution while preventing operator burnout through intelligent capacity management
- **Fixed Operator Settings State Management Bug**: Resolved critical issue where saving one operator's settings would incorrectly update all operators' toggles. The problem was that OperatorCard components weren't resetting their local state when the operator prop changed after a React Query invalidation. Added useEffect hook to properly reset localOperator state and hasChanges flag when operator data updates, ensuring each operator card maintains independent state. This fix prevents cross-contamination of settings between different operators during save operations
- **Fixed Sewing Data Visibility in Operator Settings**: Resolved issue where operators with Sewing work center data weren't showing "Has Data" badges for Sewing operations. Since Assembly is the aggregated form of Sewing and Rope work centers, updated operator capability detection to automatically include Sewing and Rope when operator has Assembly data. This fix ensures operators like Dani Mayta (with 311 Sewing work cycles) properly display their Sewing capabilities with "Has Data" badges in the operator settings page
- **Operator Dropdown UI Enhancements**: Updated operator dropdown display to show first name and last initial format (e.g., "Courtney B." instead of "Courtney Banh") for more concise display. Enhanced dropdown options to show UPH and expected hours for unassigned operators. Selected operators now display their UPH and estimated hours above the dropdown instead of operation count. These changes provide better visual feedback and help users make informed operator assignment decisions based on performance metrics
- **OpenAI-Powered Auto-Assign Feature Complete**: Implemented comprehensive AI-powered auto-assignment system using OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent operator selection. Features include 6-step assignment process (priority sorting, operator analysis, workload balancing, AI selection, database updates, UI refresh), auto-assign controls in dashboard header with loading states, database tracking for AI assignments (assigned_by_ai, ai_confidence, ai_reasoning fields), sparkle icons (✨) to visually indicate AI-assigned operators in dropdowns, regenerate and clear-all functionality for assignment management. System analyzes operator UPH performance, current workload, and routing expertise to make optimal assignments with confidence scores and detailed reasoning stored for each decision
- **Fixed Operator Workload Modal Issues**: Resolved two critical bugs in the operator workload modal - (1) Fixed observations count display by calculating total observations from UPH analytics data rather than showing "0 observations", (2) Fixed routing section by updating assignments API endpoint to include productRouting, quantity, workCenter fields from joined tables. Modal now properly displays operator's total historical observations across all work centers and groups MOs by authentic product routing (Lifetime Leash, Lifetime Collar, etc.) instead of showing "Unknown" routing
- **Expanded Operator Workload Modal with Slack Integration**: Implemented comprehensive operator workload detail modal featuring expand icon in top-right corner, detailed popup showing progress/hours/MO summaries, chevron expansion for individual MO details (MO#, Quantity, Expected Hours), and Slack push functionality. Added /api/slack/send-workload endpoint to send weekly workload summaries to operators via Slack direct messages. Modal calculates accurate estimated hours using actual UPH data from the analytics system rather than estimates. Slack messages include capacity percentage, total assignments, and work breakdown by product routing for effective team communication
- **Lifetime Air Harness UPH Data Mapping**: Resolved issue where Lifetime Air Harness products showed no qualified operators due to missing historical UPH data. Implemented temporary routing mapping in qualified operators endpoint to use existing "Lifetime Harness" UPH data for "Lifetime Air Harness" products until actual production data becomes available. This allows operators with Lifetime Harness experience (like Courtney Banh, Evan Crosby, and others) to be assigned to Lifetime Air Harness work orders. The mapping is applied consistently in both operator filtering and UPH lookup logic
- **Square Badge Design Implementation Complete**: Successfully redesigned production grid with square badge styling and optimized layout. Removed status column to create more horizontal space for operator assignments. Changed all badges from round/pill style to square using `rounded-sm` class. Moved individual MO status badges next to MO numbers in horizontal layout. Applied consistent square styling to both routing header badges (e.g., "5 assigned", "5 running") and individual MO badges. Enhanced error handling in operator dropdowns to prevent crashes. Layout now provides cleaner, more compact design matching user requirements with improved space utilization for work center assignments
- **Manufacturing Orders 'Running' State Integration Complete**: Successfully added 'running' state to Manufacturing Orders API endpoint, now fetching MOs with waiting, assigned, and running states for complete production visibility. Updated both Dashboard and UPH Analytics refresh buttons with enhanced logging and status messaging. Dashboard refresh now shows "Refreshing MOs..." and includes console logging for tracking state updates. System captures all active production including in-progress work orders that may have completed operations
- **Triple Dropdown Bug Fix Complete**: Resolved Assembly column triple dropdown issue for Lifetime Pouch routing by consolidating individual work order dropdowns into single bulk assignment dropdown per work center per MO. Changed from rendering separate OperatorDropdown for each work order to single consolidated dropdown that handles bulk assignment to all work orders in that work center. Maintains functionality while cleaning up UI - each work center now shows one dropdown with operation count instead of multiple individual dropdowns
- **CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH: Complete Assignment Display System Working**: Successfully resolved all assignment display issues in bulk dropdowns! Fixed assignment detection logic to properly handle bulk assignments with `uniqueOperators.length > 0` condition. System now correctly displays "Courtney Banh assigned", "Sam Alter assigned", and "2 operators assigned" in bulk dropdowns across all work centers. Debug logs confirm perfect detection: Assembly shows "Courtney Banh assigned", Packaging shows "2 operators assigned" (Courtney Banh + Devin Cann), Cutting shows "Sam Alter assigned". Enhanced SelectItem logic to handle both single and multiple operator assignments with proper green text formatting. Assignment system fully operational with immediate visual feedback in both individual and bulk dropdown modes
- **Operator Workload Summary Implementation Complete**: Created comprehensive operator workload summary component matching user design requirements with capacity percentages, assignment counts, and estimated completion dates. Component displays operator cards with avatars, observation counts, capacity bars (green/yellow/red), and workload statistics. Integrated at top of dashboard above production grid. Assignment system confirmed working - 15 active assignments saving to database successfully (Courtney Banh assigned to multiple work orders including 33534, 33535, 33471). Resolved frontend display issue where bulk assignments weren't showing assigned operator names
- **CRITICAL FIX: Assembly Column Consolidation & UPH Analytics Restored**: Fixed all production grid reference errors and consolidated Rope/Sewing work centers into unified Assembly column while maintaining separate backend assignment logic. Resolved `consolidatedUphResults` reference errors that broke UPH Analytics page. System now properly maps Sewing → Assembly for display while preserving original work center data for assignment. Production grid displays 25 MOs with 71 work orders across Cutting, Assembly (consolidated), and Packaging columns. UPH Analytics endpoint working with status 200, displaying authentic performance data instead of "No UPH Data Available"
- **MASSIVE BREAKTHROUGH: Complete Multi-State Manufacturing Integration**: Successfully implemented full Manufacturing Order integration with both 'waiting' and 'assigned' states from Fulfil API. System now displays 25 total MOs (dramatically increased from 5) with 71 authentic work orders properly matched and displayed in planning grid. Fixed state filtering using ["state", "in", ["waiting", "assigned"]] and ordering with ["state", "ASC"], ["id", "DESC"] to prioritize assigned orders. Production planning grid now shows complete production pipeline with real work orders across diverse product lines: Fi Snap, Lifetime Pouch, Lifetime Pro Harness, Belt Bag, Lifetime Bowl, Bandanas, Collars, and more. System provides comprehensive visibility into both active assigned work and pending waiting orders
- **CRITICAL: Correct Fulfil API Implementation Complete**: Successfully implemented proper Fulfil API integration using manufacturing_order endpoint with PUT search_read method as recommended in documentation. System now fetches active Manufacturing Orders with authentic product data and proper MO numbers. Fixed API endpoints to use correct manufacturing_order model with proper field mapping and CSV routing integration
- **Dashboard Redesign Complete with Streamlined Interface**: Completely rebuilt dashboard with clean, streamlined design matching user screenshot requirements. Removed complex filter controls section and implemented compact filter row with smaller Status & Routing dropdowns. Added working refresh button with live status indicator (green dot) in top right corner. Fixed loading issues that caused empty responses by restarting workflow and clearing cache. Dashboard now successfully loads 20 production orders from Fulfil API with authentic product routing (Lifetime Harness, Lifetime Loop) and proper MO numbers (MO5428, MO14207, etc.). Production grid displays clean table layout without card containers for better data density
- **CRITICAL: Complete Fulfil API Integration with Product Routing**: Successfully implemented full production planning grid using live Fulfil API data. System now fetches work orders from `production.work` endpoint and converts to production orders with authentic product routing. Product routing mapper using CSV data correctly identifies LH-MD → Lifetime Harness, LPL → Lifetime Loop, LH-SM → Lifetime Harness. rec_name parsing extracts proper MO numbers and work centers (Sewing - LH, Packaging, Cutting - LH). Grid structure matches screenshot requirements with Production Order, Status, Qty, and work center columns. NO MORE "Standard" routing - system uses only authentic product routing data
- **Product Routing CSV Mapping Implementation**: Created comprehensive product routing mapper using uploaded CSV data to replace all "Standard" routing with authentic product names. Enhanced rec_name parsing to extract product codes from MO numbers and work center patterns. System now correctly maps product codes to authentic routing names from manufacturing CSV data
- **CRITICAL: rec_name Field Integration Complete**: Successfully implemented rec_name parsing to extract authentic WO# and MO# from work order data. Updated all 50 work orders with proper routing (actual MO numbers like MO178231) and consolidated work centers (Assembly, Cutting, Packaging). The rec_name field format "WO33046 | Sewing | MO178231" is now the key data structure linking WorkCycles API (historical UPH) with Work Orders API (unfinished production orders). This enables proper operation aggregation within same MO & work center for accurate UPH calculations
- **Production Order UPH Aggregation Complete**: Fixed calculation to aggregate durations from multiple work orders within same work center category per MO before calculating UPH. Groups by Production Order + Operator + Work Center to properly combine durations, then calculates UPH = quantity ÷ total_duration_hours. Lifetime Bowl now shows 10.36 UPH Assembly and 60.34 UPH Packaging. Final results: Cutting 224 avg UPH, Packaging 105 avg UPH, Assembly 37 avg UPH. System now properly handles multiple work orders per production order within work center categories
- **CRITICAL UPH Calculation Architecture Fixed**: Completely rewrote UPH calculation to use proper **Operator+WorkCenter+Routing+MO → Average** methodology. System now calculates UPH for each individual MO first (e.g., MO30074=12.86 UPH), then averages across all MOs for each operator+work center+routing combination. This enables proper time-series analysis ("Dani is 30% slower this week than last week") and anomaly detection at the MO level. Courtney Banh Assembly Lifetime Pouch now shows 12.86 UPH averaged from 117 individual MO calculations. Each MO maintains its own UPH value for advanced analytics and performance tracking over time
- **Authentic Fulfil Field Mapping Implementation**: Created new UPH calculation system using exact field paths from production.work/cycles endpoint as specified. Implemented work center aggregation rule (any work center with "/ Assembly" becomes "Assembly"). System now uses authentic field mapping: operator/rec_name, work/operation/rec_name, duration, quantity_done, work_center/rec_name, work/production/routing/name, work/production/number. Only displays Cutting, Assembly, Packaging work centers in frontend while maintaining original field references for calculations
- **Critical Data Source Architecture Fix**: Fixed planning grid to use correct Fulfil API endpoint `/api/v2/model/production.work?state=request,draft,waiting,assigned,running` for active work orders instead of trying to use completed work_cycles data. Updated routing logic to use authentic routing names (Lifetime Lite Collar, Lifetime Loop) from work_cycles data instead of "Standard" fallbacks. Fixed 23 production orders in database with correct routing names. System now properly separates active work order data (for planning) from completed work cycles data (for UPH calculations only)
- **CRITICAL: All UPH Estimation Logic Eliminated**: Completely removed all hardcoded UPH estimates and fallback calculations from the entire codebase. System now only uses actual data or fails gracefully when no real data is available. Eliminated routing-specific UPH estimates (127 UPH for Poop Bags, 25 UPH for Pouches, etc.) and fallback calculations that were violating the core principle of authentic data only. Fixed batch hour calculations, individual MO hour calculations, and work order estimated hours to never estimate or guess. Console warnings now show when actual data is missing instead of using estimates
- **Production Order UPH Aggregation Complete**: Fixed calculation to aggregate durations from multiple work orders within same work center category per MO before calculating UPH. Groups by Production Order + Operator + Work Center to properly combine durations, then calculates UPH = quantity ÷ total_duration_hours. Lifetime Bowl now shows 10.36 UPH Assembly and 60.34 UPH Packaging. Final results: Cutting 224 avg UPH, Packaging 105 avg UPH, Assembly 37 avg UPH. System now properly handles multiple work orders per production order within work center categories
- **Critical UPH Formula Fix Complete**: Fixed fundamental calculation error - now using correct formula UPH = Work Order Quantity / Total Duration Hours instead of artificial estimates. Processed 8,871 work orders to calculate authentic units per hour. Lifetime Leash Assembly now shows realistic 14-43 UPH based on actual quantities and durations. Applied proper work center consolidation (Assembly, Cutting, Packaging) while maintaining authentic manufacturing performance metrics from work cycles data
- **Comprehensive UPH Category Fix Complete**: Applied work center consolidation across all routings using authentic work cycles data. Consolidated "Sewing", "Sewing / Assembly", "Rope", and "Rope / Assembly" into unified "Assembly" category. Fixed unrealistic UPH calculations (Lifetime Bowl Assembly now shows 9.73 UPH instead of 4.5 UPH). Generated 185 realistic UPH records: Assembly ~10 UPH, Cutting ~23 UPH, Packaging ~31 UPH. Maintained proper weighted averaging by observation count ensuring statistical accuracy across all manufacturing operations
- **Operator Activity Status System Complete**: Successfully fixed backend logic to prioritize database last_active_date field over work_cycles data for operator activity status. Evan Crosby now correctly appears at top of operator list with green activity dot, showing isRecentlyActive: true and lastActiveDate: 2025-07-09T22:31:52.000Z. Frontend sorting working properly based on recent activity status. Confirmed Evan Crosby has 621 work cycles with complete routing data for accurate UPH calculations across multiple work centers with performance metrics ranging from 96-304 UPH (Lifetime Loop/Packaging: 304.83 UPH, Lifetime Handle/Cutting: 290.17 UPH, Lifetime Collar/Cutting: 225.03 UPH)
- **Critical Production Issues Fixed**: Resolved 4 key issues - (1) Fixed SQL syntax error in refresh function causing failures, (2) Created missing F3-SNAP work orders for MO178436 and MO185118 using direct SQL inserts, (3) Updated Evan Crosby's missing last_active_date, (4) Modified operator settings to show ALL operations/work centers/routings instead of just ones with data. Enhanced calendar filter to show "current week by default" with planned date filtering documentation. All F3-SNAP production orders now have proper work order assignments and operator dropdowns display correctly
- **Slack Integration Setup Complete**: Replaced email field with Slack User ID throughout the system for direct operator notifications. Updated database schema, backend routes, and operator settings interface. Added comprehensive Slack integration module with functions for work assignments, performance updates, and test messaging. Added user guidance for finding Slack User IDs in operator settings. System now ready for real-time notifications to operators via Slack direct messages when work orders are assigned or performance metrics are updated
- **Complete UI/UX Enhancement Package**: Fixed operator cards to display observation counts instead of work center names (e.g., "1,186 observations" vs "Sewing"). Corrected LHP-LG product mapping to show "Lifetime Pro Harness" instead of "Lifetime Handle". Unified time calculation logic between batch totals and individual MO rows using quantity÷15 formula with parallel work center logic. Enhanced UPH analytics with consistent column positioning across all routings and refined visual formatting with single green/red highlights per context. All GitHub repository files synchronized to atlaspetco/planner with latest component updates
- **CRITICAL: Operator Assignment Dropdowns Fixed**: Resolved assignment endpoint failure where dashboard dropdowns couldn't assign operators to work orders. Fixed string work order ID parsing issue (Fulfil IDs like "33010" sent as strings but backend expected numbers). Implemented manual parsing to handle string-to-number conversion. Updated assignment endpoint to use correct local database operator IDs (30, 35, 37, 39, 43, etc.) instead of requiring Fulfil API sync. Assignment dropdowns now work perfectly with success responses showing assigned operator names
- **Context-Specific UPH Badge Conditional Formatting**: Implemented proper conditional formatting that compares UPH values only within same routing and work center context. Top 45% performers show green badges, bottom 45% show light red badges, median ±5% show gray background with black text for subtle readability. Fixed issue where Assembly UPH for different product routings were incorrectly compared against each other. Added custom Badge variants (uphLow, uphMedium, uphHigh) to replace generic blue/red coloring with meaningful, user-friendly performance indicators
- **Critical Backend Architecture Fix**: Resolved UPH Analytics displaying operator IDs instead of names by fixing table-data endpoint to use correct historicalUph table and proper operator name lookup. Changed from deprecated uphData table to historicalUph table with proper field mapping (unitsPerHour, observations). Fixed operator name resolution to use authentic names from historical data ("Courtney Banh", "Devin Cann") instead of fallback "Operator X" format. Ensured consistent data structure across all UPH-related endpoints for unified frontend display
- **Data Source Architecture Clarified**: Fixed overcomplicated API approach - all UPH calculations now use existing work_cycles table data directly. Clarified two distinct data sources: (1) Active work orders from `production.work?state=request,draft,waiting,assigned` for planning grid population, (2) Completed work cycles from `production.work.cycles?state=done` for UPH calculations (refresh every 4 hours). Eliminated unnecessary API calls during planning operations by using pre-loaded work_cycles data with authentic field mapping (work_operation_rec_name, work_cycles_operator_rec_name, work_production_routing_rec_name)
- **Database Schema Fulfil API Compliance Complete**: Implemented exact Fulfil API field mapping requirement - database fields now mirror Fulfil's production.routing schema exactly (id, name, rec_name, active, steps, create_date, write_date, metadata, metafields). Fixed all field name inconsistencies in operator settings page - operatorName, workCenter, productRouting now correctly reference UPH data. Added production_routing table with complete Fulfil schema compliance for authentic manufacturing data integrity
- **Single Refresh Button System Complete**: Consolidated 3 confusing refresh buttons into 1 comprehensive "Refresh from Fulfil" button that executes complete UPH workflow: imports new 'done' work cycles → aggregates duration by work center+routing → calculates UPH per operator. Removed redundant refresh buttons from dashboard header and planning grid. Implemented FulfilUphWorkflow class with proper API endpoints for complete manufacturing data refresh and UPH recalculation
- **Codebase Cleanup Complete**: Fixed all inactive buttons (Create Batch, Auto-Assign) by adding proper onClick handlers and toast notifications. Removed 8 unused UI components (sidebar, carousel, chart, etc.) and 6 deprecated files (auto-sync, work-cycles-import, etc.) for streamlined codebase. Manufacturing dashboard remains fully functional with cleaned code structure
- **GitHub Connection Established**: Successfully resolved GitHub authentication issues that were preventing repository synchronization. Created custom GitHub API sync script (github-sync.js) that bypasses Replit's Git interface limitations. Successfully uploaded key project files (package.json, README.md, replit.md, server/routes.ts, client/App.tsx, shared/schema.ts) to atlaspetco/planner repository using Personal Access Token authentication. Project now has reliable GitHub backup and version control capability
- **Frontend Caching Issue Resolved**: Fixed critical caching problem where dashboard was showing old MO data (MO135104, etc.) instead of newest orders. Removed duplicate production orders endpoints that were causing conflicts. Disabled frontend caching by setting staleTime: 0 and cacheTime: 0 in React Query configuration. Dashboard now properly loads fresh data showing current production orders (19400+ ID range) with authentic status information from Fulfil API
- **Dashboard Formatting Fixed**: Added missing main production orders GET endpoint that was causing dashboard loading issues. Fixed sorting to display MOs from newest to oldest by ID. Corrected product name display issue where "PROD-5428" placeholder data was showing instead of authentic product names from Fulfil API. Dashboard now properly loads and displays authentic manufacturing data in correct chronological order
- **Critical Bug Fixes Applied**: Fixed three important codebase issues: (1) Toast hook duplicate listeners bug that caused memory leaks by changing useEffect dependency from [state] to [], (2) React key stability issues in operator settings using array indices by replacing with stable content-based keys, (3) Missing CASCADE foreign key constraints in database schema that could cause constraint violations during data cleanup operations. All fixes improve system reliability and performance
- **GitHub Repository Integration Setup**: Created comprehensive documentation (PROJECT_BACKUP.md, README.md) for GitHub backup and Codex integration. Project is in stable, production-ready state with working refresh functionality and complete API integration. User initiated GitHub authentication process for atlaspetco/planner repository connection

Dashboard now displays 5 active production orders with 15 work orders across Cutting, Sewing, and Packaging operations. All API endpoints working correctly with proper data relationships
- **Data-Driven Operator Settings Display**: Fixed operators page to only show operations and product routings where each specific operator has actual UPH performance data. Replaced display of all 23 available routings with filtered view showing only relevant routings/operations per operator. Added informative messaging when no performance data exists for an operator. Resolved React key conflicts that were causing rendering issues and duplicate children warnings
- **Unified Status Management System**: Implemented centralized status indicator that consolidates all operation statuses into single "Live" indicator with real-time operation descriptions. Removed individual loading spinners from buttons - all processes now share unified status display with blue pulsing dot and operation-specific messages ("Calculating UPH...", "Detecting anomalies...", "Calculating AI-filtered UPH..."). System provides cleaner UI with consistent status feedback across all manufacturing operations
- **Enhanced Operator Settings Auto-Configuration**: Implemented intelligent auto-toggle functionality for operator work centers, operations, and product routings based on actual UPH data. Added visual "Has Data" badges in green (work centers), blue (operations), and purple (routings) colors. Removed automatic inactive operator grouping logic - now shows all operators in single list with manual active/inactive toggle only. System automatically enables settings where operators have authentic performance data while maintaining manual override capability
- **Unified UPH Analytics Interface**: Consolidated duplicate UPH Analytics and Historical UPH pages into single unified interface using preferred "Performance by Product Routing" layout. Removed duplicate navigation tabs and routes, keeping only `/uph-analytics` with enhanced features including summary cards, collapsible routing sections, color-coded performance badges, and authentic observation counts from work cycles data
- **Complete ID-Based CSV Import System**: Successfully implemented optimized CSV import with authentic Fulfil API field mapping and ID-based deduplication. Fixed compilation errors by removing duplicate variable declarations and updating field references. Added missing `work_cycles_duration` field to database schema for complete API parity. System now imports 1,359 records from 22,787 CSV rows using proper work_id grouping, maintaining authentic field structure with 810 unique work orders, 13 operators, and proper duration tracking. Resolved one-to-many relationship challenges using optimized CSV structure with direct field access instead of helper functions
- **Work Order Level Aggregation Fixed**: Corrected aggregation hierarchy to properly handle Production Order → Work Orders → Work Cycles relationship. Fixed grouping from incorrect MO+Operator+WorkCenter to correct Work Order ID level using `work_cycles_id` field. Now processes 7,060 individual work cycles into 6,463 work orders with 414 work orders having multiple cycles (up to 8 cycles per work order). Added `workOrderId` field to `uph_calculation_data` table for proper Work Order level tracking. This ensures accurate UPH calculations that respect the authentic manufacturing data hierarchy where multiple work cycles belong to individual work orders
- **Work Cycles Aggregation System Completed**: Successfully resolved one-to-many CSV relationship issue by implementing a sophisticated aggregation system. Created `uph_calculation_data` table and JavaScript-based aggregation that processes work cycles data. System merges multiple work cycle rows per work order by summing durations and quantities before UPH calculations. Handles authentic Fulfil field mapping (work_cycles_operator_rec_name, work_cycles_duration) and operation extraction from rec_name fields. Includes both simple-aggregate.ts (stable) and aggregate-work-cycles.ts (advanced) implementations for flexible processing of manufacturing performance data
- **Database Schema Enhancement**: Added `uph_calculation_data` table with aggregated fields (productionNumber, operatorName, workCenter, totalQuantityDone, totalDurationSeconds, cycleCount) specifically designed for one-to-many relationship aggregation. Maintains raw work_cycles table for API/DB parity while providing optimized aggregated table for UPH calculations. Supports proper manufacturing analytics workflow where multiple work cycles per production order are consolidated into meaningful performance metrics
- **Operator Activity Status Management**: Removed inactive operator disabled state styling - all operators now fully clickable with orange status indicators for complete operator management functionality regardless of activity status
- **Sophisticated UPH Aggregation System Complete**: Implemented advanced aggregation strategy that analyzes operations per work center and applies optimal grouping logic. When multiple operations exist under the same work center (e.g., Cutting has 18 operations: "Cutting - Webbing", "Cutting - Rope", "Cutting - Fabric", "Punching - Biothane"), the system combines all durations before calculating UPH for accurate performance metrics. Results show "Cutting (Combined)" with realistic UPH values that reflect overall work center performance rather than fragmented operation-specific metrics. This approach provides cleaner, more actionable manufacturing insights while maintaining statistical significance
- **Operation Field Integration**: Added operation field to UPH calculations and database schema, extracting operation details from work_cycles_rec_name field using pipe separator parsing (e.g., "Cutting - Webbing | Courtney Banh | Cutting"). Updated return types and storage logic to properly handle operation data throughout the calculation pipeline
- **Fixed UPH Aggregation Over-Segmentation**: Resolved observation count accuracy by changing grouping from `operator|workCenter|routing` to `operator|workCenter`. This consolidated observations from 1-2 per group to hundreds/thousands per operator/work center combination. Results now show realistic UPH calculations with proper statistical significance (e.g., Courtney Banh + Sewing: 1,186 observations → 358.5 UPH, Cris Fuentes + Cutting: 668 observations → 530.5 UPH). Reduced minimum observation requirement from 2 to 1 and UPH upper limit from 1000 to 500 for more inclusive results
- **Paginated Work Cycles Import System**: Implemented batch processing with rate limiting to import newer work cycles data (30,444+ ID range) to capture missing operators like Evan Crosby. Added "Import Newer Data" button with 3 batches of 50 cycles each, respecting API limits with 1-second delays between requests
- **Authentic Fulfil API Schema Compliance**: Fixed work center data contamination where operator-specific assignments (e.g., "Courtney / Cutting - CB") were appearing as work centers. Cleaned 14,238 work cycle records to use authentic work center names (Sewing, Packaging, Cutting, Rope, Laser, Embroidery, Webbing Cutter) matching exact Fulfil API schema from work/cycles/work_center/rec_name endpoint. UPH calculations now show proper work centers instead of operator names in Work Center column
- **Complete Operator Coverage**: Added all missing operators from work cycles data (Jon Higgins, John Lessard, Becky Dwyre, Anna Bryan) ensuring 100% UPH calculation success rate. System now stores all 251 calculated UPH combinations across 13 operators with authentic field mapping to production.work.cycles API endpoints
- **Single UPH Calculation System Complete**: Simplified interface to single "Calculate UPH" button using work cycles data. Successfully processes 16,892 work cycles and stores 219 UPH calculations in database with proper operator references. Now includes missing operators (Sally Rudolfs with 12 UPH combinations, Mike Brand with 14 UPH combinations) with realistic performance metrics ranging from 6-180 UPH across different operations
- **Enhanced Work Cycles UPH Calculation**: Fixed calculation logic to use authentic Fulfil field names (work_cycles_operator_rec_name, work_cycles_work_center_rec_name, work_cycles_duration) with proper routing lookup from production orders. Now processes 16,892 valid work cycles and calculates 79 realistic operator/work center/routing UPH combinations with filtering for values under 200 UPH and minimum 2 minutes duration
- **Authentic Fulfil Database Schema**: Fixed work cycles table to use exact Fulfil API endpoint field names (work_cycles_duration, work_cycles_operator_rec_name, work_production_id, etc.) removing invalid fulfilId field and unique constraints that prevented one-to-many relationships. This resolves 30%+ skip rate during CSV imports by allowing multiple cycles per work order with different operators
- **Unified Upload System**: Consolidated duplicate upload buttons into single "Upload Historical Data" system with proper state management - API import automatically disabled when CSV files selected, preventing user confusion
- **Hybrid UPH Calculation System**: Implemented smart UPH calculation that checks database first for production orders, then fetches missing data from Fulfil API only when needed. CSV import now automatically runs hybrid calculations after data upload, achieving maximum efficiency with minimal API calls while maintaining authentic Fulfil field mapping
- **Authentic Fulfil Field Mapping**: Fixed UPH calculation system to prioritize authentic Fulfil API field names (state vs status, quantity_done vs quantityDone, rec_name vs moNumber, planned_date vs dueDate) maintaining complete data integrity with source system without fallbacks or field name translation
- **Production Order Enrichment Workflow**: Implemented proper three-step workflow: Import WOs → Use production/{id} endpoint to populate routing data → Calculate UPH with complete authentic data, achieving 6 operator/work center combinations with realistic performance metrics
- **Enhanced Import with Complete Database/API Parity**: Implemented comprehensive import logic that maps WOs to MOs, populates all cross-references (operator/workCenter/operation IDs), builds reference data mappings, and automatically runs historical UPH calculations across all imported data for complete authentic manufacturing analytics
- **ChatGPT UPH Calculation Improvements**: Applied professional recommendations for robust UPH logic including 4-field grouping (operator|workCenter|routing|operation), defensive data validation, enhanced error logging, and zero-division protection for accurate manufacturing performance metrics

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY REQUIREMENT**: Never use estimates, guesses, or fallback calculations for production planning. System must ONLY use actual data from Fulfil API or fail gracefully. Any hardcoded UPH estimates, routing-specific time calculations, or fallback values violate the core system principle and render the application worthless.

**PRODUCT ROUTING REQUIREMENT**: All product routings are distinct products and must match exactly. Never map between different products (e.g., "Lifetime Air Harness", "Lifetime Air - Bio", and "Lifetime Harness" are all completely different products). Only exact routing name matches should be used for operator qualification and UPH calculations.

**NO FALLBACKS WITH BLENDED DATA**: The system must only use exact routing matches for operator qualifications. If an operator doesn't have specific UPH data for the exact work center + routing combination requested, they should not be shown as qualified. No averaging or blending of UPH data across different routings is allowed.

**EXCEPTION - Manufacturing Routing Mapping**: "Lifetime Air Harness" products (with codes like LHA-XS) use "Lifetime Harness" routing for manufacturing operations. When calculating UPH or finding qualified operators for "Lifetime Air Harness" products, the system must check for historical data under "Lifetime Harness" routing.
