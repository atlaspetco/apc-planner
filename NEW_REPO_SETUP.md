# Create New Git Repository - Manufacturing Dashboard

## Step 1: Remove Current Git Repository (Manual)
You'll need to do this in the Shell since Replit restricts Git operations:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

## Step 2: Initialize Fresh Repository
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Manufacturing Dashboard with Fulfil API integration"
```

## Step 3: Create New GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Click "New Repository"
3. Name: `manufacturing-dashboard` or `planner-v2`
4. Description: "Manufacturing production planning dashboard with Fulfil API integration"
5. Set to Private
6. Don't initialize with README (we have files already)

## Step 4: Connect to New Remote
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 5: Configure Replit Git Integration
After pushing, you can connect this Replit to the new repository through the Git panel.

## Current Project Status
✅ **Manufacturing Dashboard Working**: 18 production orders, 46 work orders
✅ **Fulfil API Connected**: Real-time data sync
✅ **Operator System**: All 13 operators available
✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL with complete schema

The new repository will have a clean history without the 45+20 commit conflicts.
